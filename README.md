# I-think-my-boyfriend-is-a-extreme-hacker-or-scammer-Help-
He hides his files on a pow kitty concole, he has access to my whole phone and changes all my settings so I can’t see results about him or what he does if I do find stuff it’s all encrypted. He even hides the Wi-Fi networks. He isn’t working alone. I know he has account on here. He has messages in kindle books and commercial emails are all weird when you zoom in and hold down and copy the link that took me to Jamusic something? Why is he hiding this from me? What do I do? Should I get a investigator? I believe he makes advertising crap, I don’t know if he’s a scammer or what? Help!!?
